There is something wrong with having only one output device, namely the framebuffer.
I know that on a graphics card, there is only one output - the framebuffer.
But, for debugging purposes, it should be possible to choose a direct renderer, 
so one can see the result immediately.

Therefore, I propose that a pure virtual output-device is defined. 
Then the framebuffer can be derived from that, and other output-devices can also be derived
from that general output-device.
